In visible-light pictures, this region cannot be seen at all because dust lying between Earth and the galactic center blocks our view.')">

This is the first time that ALMA has ever observed the surface of a star and this first attempt has resulted in the highest-resolution image of Betelgeuse available.')">

Japanese and Chinese astronomers recorded this violent event in 1054 CE.')">
